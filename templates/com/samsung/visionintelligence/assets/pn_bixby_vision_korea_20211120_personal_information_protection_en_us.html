<b>6. Destruction Procedures and Methods</b><br />
<br />
Procedures and methods for the destruction of personal information are as follows:<br />
<br />
<b><span style='font-size: 15px'>(1) Destruction Procedures</span></b><br />
After its purpose is fulfilled, users' personal information is moved
to a separate DB (in the case of printed material, this should be stored in
paper cabinets) and is kept for a certain period and is destroyed for privacy
protection in accordance with the internal policy and applicable law (see the "7.
Retention and Use Period"). The personal information kept in a separate DB is
not used for another purpose, unless otherwise required by law.<br />
<br />

<b><span style='font-size: 15px'>(2) Destruction Methods</span></b><br />
All personal information stored in electronic format is deleted by
using technology that prevents the data from being restored. Personal
information printed out on paper is shredded or incinerated.<br />

<br />
<br />
<b>7. Outsourcing Personal Information Processing and International Transfers</b><br />
<br />
We outsource the processing of personal information to third parties
in order to provide services. Personal information processing is outsourced to
each service provider, only to the extent that this will be necessary to provide
each service individually.<br />
<br />
In respect of personal information disclosed to service providers, in
order to safeguard privacy we mandate such service providers clearly to: comply
with data protection instructions; keep personal information confidential; not share
data with third parties; take full responsibility in the event of an incident; and
return or destroy personal information after outsourcing or use of the data ceases.
We supervise them to ensure the secure processing of personal information. 
If a service provider or its task is changed, we will let you know by placing a notice on the Bixby Vision.<br />
<br />

<b>8. Others</b><br />
<br />
<b><span style='font-size: 15px'>(1) Technical and Organizational Measures to Safeguard Personal
Information</span></b><br />
<br />
We have implemented the following technical and organizational
measures to prevent personal information from being lost, stolen, leaked,
altered, or damaged in the course of processing users' personal information.<br />
<br />
-Internal Management Plan<br />
. We have established and implemented an internal management plan for ensuring the secure
processing of personal information.<br />
. We have set up an division dedicated to privacy and data protection, which checks whether the
concerned personnel comply with the safeguards for personal information and
promptly take corrective measures upon detecting a problem.<br />
<br />
- Access Control<br />
. We control unauthorized access through an intrusion prevention system and seek to equip
all technical devices in order to ensure security in the system.<br />
<br />
- Prevention against Access Record Forgery and Alteration<br />
. We keep and manage the access records of the personal information processing system and use the
security features in order to prevent the access records from being forged or altered<br />
<br />
- Encryption<br />
. Your personal information is protected by passwords, stored, and managed after encrypting the
files and transmitted data or locking the files. Important data is protected
using additional security features.<br />
<br />
- Prevention against Cyber Attacks<br />
. We use antivirus software to prevent any cyber threat. Our antivirus program is regularly
updated. In case of a new threat, we provide the antivirus solution the moment
it is available in order to prevent personal data breaches.<br />
. We adopt Secure Socket Layer (SSL), which ensures the secure transmission of personal
information via the network by using an encryption algorithm.<br />
. We utilize intrusion prevention systems and vulnerability assessment systems on each server
in order to prevent cyberattacks.<br />
. We do not keep personal information and general data together but store them separately using
individual servers.<br />
<br />
- Minimization and Education of Staff Who Handle User Information<br />
. We grant access to users' personal information only to those who are involved in marketing
activities dealing with customers directly, those who
manage personal information, such as the Chief Privacy Officer and other
relevant personnel, and those who inevitably handle personal information for
business purposes.<br />
. We provide regular education programs for employees who handle personal information both within
the company and through outside professionals about new
security technology and personal information protection obligations.<br />
. We prevent human-caused data breaches by making all employees sign a confidentiality
pledge before joining the company and putting in place internal procedures to
audit compliance with the personal information protection measures by employees.<br />
. The transfer of duties to successors from those who handle personal information is thoroughly
conducted under high security, and we hold employees for any data incident
responsible after joining or leaving the company.<br />
. We designate computer rooms and data archives as restricted areas and control the access to
them.<br />
<br />

<b><span style='font-size: 15px'>(2) Direct Marketing Communications</span></b><br />
We do not send marketing messages for commercial purposes without your prior consent.<br />
