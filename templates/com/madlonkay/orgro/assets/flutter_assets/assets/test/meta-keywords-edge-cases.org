*Malformed* comment (subscript is rendered in Emacs):

#foo_bar

*Malformed* block delimiter:

# +begin_src

Orphaned block delimiter (subscript is not rendered in Emacs, but it is rendered
on export):

#+begin_src

Comment following orphaned block delimiter is not correctly syntax-highlighted
in Emacs on buffer reload, but it does parse as a comment per
=org-element-at-point=:
